This folder contains generated (binary) class files with Java 9 signatures
for some classes, so it allows us to compile a multi-release JAR with
previous version of Java.

All files here were automatically generated by "ant generate-java9-stubs".
To do this, you need to run this command with Java 9! The files have no
bytecode, they are just stubs to provide javac with correct method signatures
in binary form.

By adding this folder to the bootclasspath of javac we are able to compile
classes for a multi-release JAR that would otherwise require the Java 9 class
library to compile.
